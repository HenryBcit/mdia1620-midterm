# üåô Midterm Evaluation ‚Äì Sleep Tracking Logic

## üìò Overview

This midterm focuses on applying console.log, if/else, and basic conditional logic in JavaScript.  
You will build a simple console-based sleep tracker that asks about the user‚Äôs rest, reacts to responses, and tracks "rest points" to measure sleep quality.

No arrays, loops, or advanced features are required ‚Äî only if, else if, and else statements.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Clone the activity repository:

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/HenryBcit/mdia1620-midterm.git"
```

2. **Run the prepare file:**

```bash
node prepare.js
```

3. **Find `init.js`:**

- Use `cd` and `ls` repeatedly until you reach the deepest folder.
- Use `ls` to confirm `init.js` is present.

4. **Run the chat:**

```bash
node init.js
```

## üåï Level 1 ‚Äì Foundation: Sleep Input & Condition

### Objective

- Use an if statement to give a simple response based on whether the user slept.

### Instructions

1. Look for the function

```bash
function AskInitialQuestion()
```

2. Look for the comment

```bash
/*Write your code below here*/


/*Write your code above here*/
```

3. Read the Task below and think about how you plan to write your logic (DO NOT START YET!)
4. Modify the question to `Did you sleep last night?`
5. Find the comment

```bash
/*
if(logic){
  //write your console.log here
}
*/
```

inside where you are supposed to write the code, and uncomment it. Remove the word `logic` and add in your own `===` statement based on the task below. 6. Add another `if` statement yourself for the other task where the answer is `no`

### Task

- Ask the user: `Did you sleep last night?`
  1. If the user input is `yes`, log: `Wonderful! Let's track your sleep hours`.
  2. If the user input is `no`, log: `No worries. Let's see how we can help`.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Input Handling ‚Äî Program correctly takes user input (3 pts)
- Conditional Logic ‚Äî Uses if / else correctly (3 pts)
- Output Clarity ‚Äî Response message matches user input (3 pts)

### Total: 9 points

## üåú Level 2 ‚Äì Describing Sleep Duration

### Objective

- Use multiple conditions (if OR else if OR else) to modify a variable, and report back the status

### Instructions

**Before you start**  Look for the comment `//create your sleepTime variable here.`
Go to the if statement for your `yes` condition in the function
```bash
function AskInitialQuestion()
```
After your console log for the `yes` statement, run `AskSleepDuration()` by typing in 
```bash
if(...){
  console log ...
  AskSleepDuration();
}
```
From this point onward you can modify the `AskSleepDuration()` function.

1. Look for the function

```bash
function AskSleepDuration()
```

2. Look for the comment

```bash
/*Write your code below here*/


/*Write your code above here*/
```

3. Read the Task below and think about how you plan to write your logic (DO NOT START YET!)
4. Modify the question to `Describe how long you slept?`
5. Find the comment

```bash
/*
if(logic){
  //modify the variable and do the console log here
}
*/
```

inside where you are supposed to write the code, and uncomment it. Remove the word `logic` and add in your own `===` statement based on the task below. 
6. Add all other `if` statement yourself for the other task where the answer is `no`

### Task

- Create a variable named `sleepTime` with a default value of 0
- Inside the function `AskSleepDuration()`, ask: `Describe how long you slept?`
- Assign a number value and a log to `sleepTime` based on their response:

| User Input    | sleepTime | Example Console Response                            |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "whole night" | 8         | "That‚Äôs a full night of rest!"                      |
| "a few hours" | 4         | "Not bad, but try to get a bit more sleep tonight." |
| "not much"    | 2         | "You must be tired ‚Äî make time to rest."            |
| "barely"      | 1         | "Running on empty! Try to get some deep rest soon." |

- At the end of the function just give a status logging `"We've estimated that you've slept "+ sleepTime +" hours"`.  For example, if it the input was "barely", then the log at the end will say `"We've estimated that you've slept 1 hours". For this part I am looking for you to use your variable as part of your console log.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Conditional Range ‚Äî Correct use of multiple conditions (3 pts)
- Logical Accuracy ‚Äî Correctly assigns `sleepTime` (3 pts)
- Prints appropriate feedback (3 pts)

### Total: 9 points

## üå† Level 3 ‚Äì Tracking Rest Points

### Objective

- Combine math and logic to simulate tracking "restPoints" and sleep health.

### Instructions

**Before you start** 
Create a restPoints variable and have an initial value of 0. Look for the function `AskSleepDuration()`.

```bash
function AskSleepDuration()
```
After your final console log about the sleepTime, run `TrackSleepStatus()` by typing in 

```bash
console log ... with sleepTime
TrackSleepStatus();
```
From this point onward you can modify the `TrackSleepStatus()` function.

1. Look for the function

```bash
function TrackSleepStatus()
```

2. Look for the comment

```bash
/*Write your code below here*/


/*Write your code above here*/
```

3. Read the Task below and think about how you plan to write your logic (DO NOT START YET!)
4. Modify the question to `How do you want me to help?`
5. Find the comment

```bash
/*
if(logic){

  //run 2nd logic
  if(logic2){
    //do your math here
  }
}
*/
```

inside where you are supposed to write the code, and uncomment it. Remove the word `logic` and add in your own comparison statements based on the task below. 
6. Add all other `if` statement yourself for the other task where the answer is `no`

### Task

- create a variable
- After describing sleep, ask:
  How do you want me to help? (type `exit` to exit)

**Two main options**

1. if the user input is `track`  
   Use the `sleepTime` value to update a global `restPoints` variable:

   - If `sleepTime` is below 2, add 5 `restPoints`
   - If `sleepTime` between 3‚Äì5, add 10 `restPoints`
   - If `sleepTime` between 6‚Äì8, add 15 `restPoints`

2. `stats`  
   Display the user‚Äôs current restPoints:
   - if `restPoints` is below 30, "You‚Äôre running low on rest ‚Äî try to recharge soon."
   - if `restPoints` between 30‚Äì70, "You‚Äôre in a healthy rest zone."
   - if `restPoints` above 70, "You‚Äôre well-rested and balanced!"

3. `restart`
  Ask the inistial question.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Numeric Conversion ‚Äî Correctly assigns numeric values to `restPoints` (1 pt)
- Conditional Logic ‚Äî Uses conditions to assign proper  (1 pt)
- Rest Point Tracking ‚Äî Correctly updates and evaluates `sleepTime` and `restPoints` (1 pt)
- Completion Condition ‚Äî Logic does what the user inputs (1 pt)

### Total: 4 points

üåßÔ∏è Bonus Challenge ‚Äì Sleep Problems

Modify another function `CheckSleepProblems()` that asks:
What happened last night?

This function will only run if you answer `no` from the initial question.

Deduct points and add comments based on keywords:

| Keyword in Input | Effect / Response Example                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "noise"          | Deduct 5 points ‚Äì "Try earplugs or white noise next time." |
| "stress"         | Deduct 10 points ‚Äì "Take a moment to unwind before bed."   |
| "screens"        | Deduct 8 points ‚Äì "Avoid screens an hour before sleep."    |
| "late work"      | Deduct 6 points ‚Äì "Try setting a fixed bedtime routine."   |

Once the deduction is applied, return to the initial question.


### Total Points: 26 + Bonus
